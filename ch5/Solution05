Debugger:
(n&(n-1))==0

This condition is used to check if the number 'n' consists of only one 1 bit set in the number. That 1 bit can be anywhere in the binary representation.
If there is n with more than one bits as 1, then n & (n-1) will never be zero.

e.g. n = 1100

n-1 = 1011

n & (n-1) = 1000 != 0

if n = 100

n-1 = 011

n & (n-1) = 0

So n should be of some power of 2 (or zero) in order to hold this condition.
